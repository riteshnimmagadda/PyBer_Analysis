# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to visualise the Pyber fares by city type on a line graph. For this, city data and ride data are merged together.

## Results
Looking at the Pyber ride-sharing data, it clearly states that a PyBer does a lot of rides in the Urban city types and followed by suburban and then rural. As we can see in the below picture, The total number of drivers is also proportional to the number of rides by city type. However, the average fare per ride is higher in the rural areas when compared to the urban areas. This could be due to longer commute distances in the rural areas. It also applies same for the avergae fare charged by drivers by City type.

When looking at the Average fares by city type over a period of the first four months in a year, all the city types have couple of things in common:

* There is a spike during the end of Feb and begining of march. 
* They all started out slower at the begning of the year.

Suburbans areas have seen an increase in the usage towards the end of April while Urban and Rural see a decline. 



## Summary

Rural areas relatively account of lesser number of rides and this could be due to the number of drivers in thoes type of cities, however, the fares in the rural areas are higher when compared to Urban and Suburban areas. This analysis did not account for the average number of miles driven per ride in each type of city - with that we would have a better understanding about the fare structure in each area.
